The optical constants of five naturally occurring rocks have been determined 
in the spectral range between 0.2 and 50 pm. Between 0.2 and 5 pm, tho real and 
imaginary parts of the index of refraction were found from a combination of 
reflectivity and transmission measurements by using Beer’s law and the Fresnel 
reflectivity equation. At wavelenths beyond 5 pm only reflectivity measurements 
could be made and both constants were found from an application of classical 
dispersion theory. These optical constants will be valuable for studies of the 
interaction of light with rock surfaces, atmospheric dust and interplanetary and 
interstellar dust grains.

glass, basalt and andesite were cut into 
l-cm thick slabs and into a series of thin 
sections of nominal thickness 30, 100, 300, 
and 1OOOpm. The thin sections were 
ground as finely as possible on one face 
and polished on the other, care being 
taken to insure that the two faces were 
parallel. The actual thickness of each 
section was found using a calibrated 
microscope that could be read to about 
1 pm. The l-cm slabs were highly polished 
using standard techniques involving a 
final polish with optical grade tin oxide.

Reflection and transmission spectra of 
the prepared sections were obtained with 
a Cary 14 spectrophotometer from 0.2

spectrophotometer from 2.5 to 50pm.

Both are dual beam instruments. Each 
spectrum was obtained at least twice, 
usually on different days with different 
orientations of the rock surfaces. This gave 
some idea of the importance of effects due 
to large scale inhomogeneities in the rock, 
to orientation of the rock, or to random 
experimental error. Generally, each re-
peated spectrum agreed with the original 
to within a few percent. 

A retlectometer built by Barnes Engin-
eering Company was used to obtain 
reflection spectra with the Perkin Elmer 
instrument. These measurements were 
made at an angle of 11" from normal 
incidence, with the reflectivity measured 
relative to a standard mirror. The standard 
mirror was assumed to reflect 96% of the 
incident energy at all wavelengths between 

2.5 and 5Opm. A reflectometer built by 
P. L. Hartman and E. Logothetis (1964) 
was used with the Cary 14 machine. This 
device measures the absolute reflectivity 
at a 13” angle from normal incidence. 
The Perkin Elmer and Cary 14 spectro-
photometers were checked against each 
other and against a second Cary 14 by 
measuring the transmission through 
various metal screens and checking for 
continuity across the overlapping wave-
lengths. The agreement was within the 
minimum experimental error of about 1% 
encountered in using the instruments. 

Measurements for which the sample 
beam intensity was less than 1% of the 
reference beam intensity were generally 
disregarded, since they are particularly 
sensitive to stray light and other errors. 
The Perkin Elmer is nonlinear in wave-
length and greatly compresses the region 
from 30 to 50pm. Taken together with 
changes in the optical system of the 
machine this makes small changes in the 
spectra from 30 to 5Opm difficult to detect. 
The Cary 14 produced erratic intensity 
measurements in the range from 0.7 to 
2.5pm. Although not greatly different 
from the values expected, they were 
clearly in error. This is attributed to light 
scattering in the samples, which is sig-
nificant in this part of the spectrum 
because of the optical system used. Con-
sequently, the data have been linearly 

extrapolated across this region. The extra-
polation is consistent with the actual 
behavior of the spectra. 

OPTICALCONSTANTS .2-5pm 

We will first discuss our estimate of the 
extinction coefficients and then turn to our 
determination of the refractive indices. In 
the spectral regions where reliable trans-
mission measurements can be made 
through various thickness, t, of rock, the 
sum of the extinction coefficient (k) and 
volume scattering coefficient (k,) can be 
found from Beer’s Law (Wendlandt and 
Hecht, 1966, Lothian, 1963). 

I = I, (1 -R)2 exp[-47r(k + k,) t/h] (2) 

In the above equation I, I,, R, and X are 
the measured intensity, the intensity 
measured in the absence of the sample, the 
surface reflectivity, and the wavelength 
respectively. Rewriting this in terms of 
logarithmic absorption units, we have 

47r(k + k,) 

log,,+= Xln 1. t-21nf&R). (3) 

The slope of the straight line found from 
plotting the transmission in absorption 
units against the thin section thickness 
uniquely determines the volume scattering 
plus extinction coefficients. This measure-
ment is independent of surface effects 
which enter as the intercept of the plot. 
The average deviation of the data from a 
least mean square fit determines the 
degree to which Beer’s law is obeyed. This 
is commonly used as a check for stray 
radiation, multiple scattering, or other 
experimental error (Lothian, 1963). For 
the glasses the data presented here yield 
deviations from a least mean square fit 
which are not any larger than the un-
certainties of about a percent associated 
with the individual measurements. Trans-
mission spectra could only be made 
through two thin sections for andesite and 
basalt because of their high opacity, so that 
this check on the data cannot be applied. 

The extinction coefficients (assuming k, 
to be negligibly small) are given in Table 
II and shown graphically from 0.2 to

3.5pm in Fig. 1. A minor amount of 
smoothing has been done to join regions 
where the optics change in the spectro-
photometers, or regions in which the 
number of sections through which trans-
mission measurements are possible, change. 

Across the above range of wavelengths 
the extinction coefficient differs con-
siderably between rocks and glasses. There 
are two orders of magnitude between the 
more transparent obsidian and andesite. 
The two obsidians differ by one order of 
magnitude which results in a difference in 
transmission readily apparent to the 
naked eye. An interesting spectral feature 
occurs near 2.8 pm which can be attributed 
to water, bound in the rocks and glasses 
(Lyon, 1963).

FIG. 1. Optical constants 0.2-3.5pm. The 
refractive index of andesite and obsidian (Little 
Glass Mt.) have been left out for clarity. The 
bars near 0.5pm on the refractive index of 
obsidian and basaltic glass are Becke Line 
measurements. 

The refractive index can be found once 
the extinction coefficient is known by 
using Fresnel’s equation for reflection at 
normal incidence : 

R = (n -1)2 + k2 

(4)
(n-t 1)2 +k2’ 

This equation is known to be applicable 
even for reflection not at normal incidence 
so long as the angle of incidence is small 
(Wendlandt and Hecht, 1966). 

The refractive index is given in Table II 
and shown up to 3.5pm in Fig. 1. Because 
the refractive indices of the two obsidian 
samples and of the basalt and andesite 
samples are quite similar, only the Lake 
Co. obsidian, basalt and, basaltic glass 
values are plotted in Fig. 1. An indepen-
dent check on the refractive index in the 
visible can be made using the Becke line 
method. This technique consists of micro- 
scopically comparing the rocks with a set 
of liquids whose refractive indices are 
known. A comparison between the values 
of the refractive index derived from the 
reflection measurements and the Becke 
Line techniques is shown in Fig. 1 for 
several of the samples. For all three glasses 
the Becke line index agrees with the index 
determined from the reflectivity to within 
the accuracy of the measurements. Be-
cause the andesite and basalt are opaque 
and microscopically inhomogeneous the 
Becke line method cannot be used. How-
ever, published data indicate that for 
“glassy” andesite the refractive index at a 
fixed wavelength in the visible lies between 

1.489 and 1.529, averaging 1.512 (George, 
1924). The refractive index found from 
reflectivity measurements appears to be 
systematically lower than the average by 
about 3%. For basalt the only published 
refractive index indicates a difference of 
nearly 10% in the refractive index found 
from reflectivity measurements. However, 
it is likely that basalt shows a very large 
variation from rock to rock. For example 
basaltic glass, a basalt derivative, has 
refractive indices ranging from 1.506 to 
1.612. The 10% error in refractive index, 
which corresponds to the measured re-
flectivity being only two-thirds of what it 
should be, is probably an upper limit to 

380 POLLACK, TOON, 

the systematic error in t’he data given 
here. 

OPTICAL CONSTANTS 5-50 pm 

Beyond 5 pm reliable transmission 
measurements could not be made and it was 
therefore necessary to find the optical 
constants from reflection spectra alone. 
There are numerous methods of doing this, 
including measurements of reflectance at 
two angles (Simon, 1951) and calculations 
based upon single spectra at normal 
incidence using the KramersKronig re-
lations or dispersion theory (Spitzer and 
Kleinman, 1961). The dispersion approach 
has been adopted here because it is the 
simplest both experimentally and mathe-
matically, produces more reliable results 
for small extinction coefficients, and has 
been successfully applied to complex 
spectra such as quartz (Spitzer and 
Kleinman, 1961). 

AND KHARE 

Dispersion analysis consists of attribu-
ting the reflection spectra to a set of 
classical oscillators. One attempts to 
determine the wavelength, X,, strength 
p, and width, r, associated with these 
oscillators, as well as the short wavelength 
dielectric constant, A. This determination 
may be facilitated by assuming initially 
that each reflection feature represents an 
oscillator that is isolated from every other 
oscillator. Using the simplified single band 
theory presented by Hansen and Pollack 
(1970) and Fresnel’s equation, one can 
obtain a,n initial estimate of the dielectric 
constant A, and all three parameters for 
each oscillator.

and Ah is the difference in wavelength 
between the value of interest h and X, the 
position of maximum nk, which is approx- 
imately the position of maximum re-
flectivity. Combining the above equations 
with the Fresnel reflectivity equation and 
successively setting AX = 0, r/2, -co, we 
obtain first order estimates of h,, A, r and 
P for each observed reflectivity feature. 
With these first order guesses one utilizes 
the full dispersion equations written in 
terms of these parameters (Spitzer and 
Kleinman, 1961) :

where the subscriptj refers to an individual 
oscillator. These two equations can be 
solved for n and k which in turn lead to the 
reflectivity, R, through Fresnel’s equation. 
One compares this reflectivity with the 
experimental one and, based on the differ- 
ence between the two, guesses better values 
for the dispersion parameters. This goes on 
until the dispersion and experimental 
curves match. Of course, care must be 
taken to use only the minimum number of 
oscillators necessary to make a good fit. 
In practice one does all this calculating by 

machine. It is possible to calculate, print 

and plot n, k and R from the hypothetical 
dispersion parameters for up to 9 oscilla- 
tors, at wavelengths from 0 to 50pm, in a 

matter of a few minutes and very cheaply 
using a Hewlett Packard 9100 B series 
desk”calculator, plotter, and printer.

A comparison between the measured 
reflectivity and that predicted by the 
dispersion analysis is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. 
The observed values are indicated by dots 
with their associated error bars, while the 
solid line represents the predicted value. 
The dispersion parameters are given in 
Table III. 

From 2.5 to 30pm the dispersion 
reflectivity fits the experimental reflec-
tivity to 0.4% in absolute value 
for andesite, basalt, and basaltic glass, 
and 0.9% for obsidian. The experimental 
error in measuring the reflectivity averages 
1.4% for andesite, basalt and basaltic glass 
and 0.8% for obsidian. The larger difference

reflectivity for the obsidians than for the 
other materials is due to the obsidians 
having higher, steeper bands. A minor 
change in the width of the dispersion curve 
therefore yields a large change in the 
difference between measured and calcula-
ted reflectance. The greatest experimental 
error is 3.2% while the worst mismatch 
between dispersion and experiment is 
4.4% in absolute values. In both cases the 
greatest errors occur on the sides of bands. 

The data beyond 30pm indicate the 
presence of bands beyond 50p.m (Spitzer 
and Kleinman, 1961). For this reason it was 
not possible to fit the experimental data 
exactly from 30 to 50pm. This part of the 
spectrum is further confused by the 


TERRESTRIAL ROCKS AND GLASSES 383 

experimental difficulties already men-
tioned, making small slopes upwards or 
downwards difficult to detect. It should 
also be noted that the dispersion analysis 
only takes into account the Restrahlen 
features beyond 8pm. It does not include 
the transmission feature near 2.8pm, nor 
the ultraviolet bands. Thus, the dispersion 
analysis becomes unreliable at very short 
wavelengths. 

The dispersion parameters themselves 
are not the object of this study. Their 
accuracy is difficult to judge because of the 
interconnection between the bands. By 
fixing all the dispersion parameters except 
one, and varying it until some noticeable 
change occurs in the calculated reflection 
spectrum some idea of the accuracy of the 

26-

parameters can be found: A, has an un-
certainty of less than 0.5%, while the 
error in A, p, and .P is on the order of 2%. 
The error is difficult to judge where bands 
overlap. The band at the highest wave-
length is particularly uncertain due to 
overlap with preceding bands, experi-
mental uncertainty beyond 30t~m, and the 
possibility of bands beyond 50pm which 
have not been included. 

The optical constants found from the 
dispersion analysis are given in Table II. 
Figure 4 shows the optical constants for the 
Glass Mt. obsidian, basaltic glass and 
andesite samples. The Lake Co. obsidian 
and basalt samples have indices very 
similar to the Glass Mt. obsidian and 
andesite sample at these wavelengths.

Their optical constants are shown separ-
ately in Figs. 6 and 7 which are discussed 
later. 

The optical constants could have sig-
nificant errors if the dispersion analysis is 
extremely sensitive, or if the reflectivity 
measurements upon which the dispersion 
analysis is based are greatly influenced by 
scattering. The agreement between the 
Becke line measurement and the refractive 
index found from the reflectivity indicate 
that scattering effects are very small for 
the glasses in the visible. Microscopic 
examinations indicate the surface rough-
ness of the glasses is quite small so that the 
reflectivity at the larger wavelengths upon 
which the dispersion analysis is based 
should be even less influenced by scattering. 
The effects of scattering are more difficult 
to evaluate for basalt and andesite. Once 
again microscopic investigation leads one 
to expect that scattering should be much 
less important at large wavelengths. For 
example, studies of the effects of surface 
roughness on normal reflection from 
polished surfaces indicate that even if the 
ratio of the measured to real reflectivity 
is only 66% at 0.5pm, by 1Opm the ratio 
will be well over 96% (Bennett and Por-
teus, 1961). 

A check of the effect upon the optical 

40 I I I I I-I

35-

constants of small changes in the dispersion 

parameters is easily made. Figures 5 and 6 

show the results of adding and subtracting 

entire bands from the dispersion model of 

obsidian (Lake Co. Oregon). In Fig. 5 we 

compare the reflectivity values predicted 

by two dispersion analyses with the 

observed values, while in Fig. 6 we show 

the differences in optical constants im-

plied by the two analyses. The primitive 

model indicated by the dotted curve in 

Fig. 5, and the squares in Fig. 6 contains 

only two bands, while the more sophistica-

ted one, indicated by the solid curve in 

Fig. 5 and the triangles in Fig. 6, adds a 

weak band just short of the main g-pm 

band, a relatively strong, but broad band 

at about 14pm, and a relatively strong 

band at about 23.5pm. The first two are 

required to account for low amplitude 

shoulders and peaks that are apparent in 

the data and reported in other published 

spectra (Lyon, 1964). The band at 23.5~” 

is needed to fit the far side of the major 

band located there. 

The band short of 9pm produces very 

little change in the optical constants. The 

same effect was noted in the other rocks; 

superimposing bands to make a large one, 

or to account for small structure in a large 

band results in optical constants that

improve the values significantly at long 
wavelengths. After adding the bands near

apparent than is indicated by the devia-
tion of the crude two-band model from the

peaks. This may be compared with three 
peaks seen for our crystalline rock samples, 
the andesite and basalt, and two peaks for 
the glasses. 

A comparison of the dispersion para-
meters helps account for the difference. 
The values of the dispersion parameters 
found for quartz by Spitzer and Kleinman 
(1961) are summarized in Table IV and 
may be compared with the values found 
for our samples, which are listed in Table 

III. The strong bands near 9,12, and 20pm 
correspond to Si-0 stretch, Xi-Si stretch, 
and Si-0-Si bending vibrational funda-
mentals, respectively. We see that the 
widths r of our rock bands are sub-
stantially greater than the width of the 
quartz bands, even if one were to combine 
the E and 0 bands for quartz. The larger 
widths of the rock bands can be attributed 
to the presence of atoms other than Si and 
0 in their structures as well as imperfec- 
tions in the crystal structure. As a result 
of the greater widths of the bands of the 
crystalline rocks there is a blending of the 
bands near 2Op.m into a single broad 
feature, which shows fine structure due to 
the individual band components. In the 
case of the obsidian glasses the width of 
their 14-p” feature is so broad that it 
causes no major peaking of the reflectivity 
spectra, even though it has a strength 
comparable to the other major bands. Also, 
in the case of the obsidian glasses the two 
bands near 2Opm are quite close together 
and are relatively broad so that the 
corresponding peak in the reflectivity data 
shows no apparent fine structure. The 
apparent absence of a band near 14~” for 
the basaltic glass and the apparent 
existence of only one band near 20pm 
can be attributed to width effects rather 
than to the real absence of such bands. In 
summary, there is a good correspondence 
between the major bands derived for 
quartz and those derived for our rock 
samples, although the rock bands are 
much broader and have somewhat differ-
ent wavelength centers. 

A band near 3t~rn in wavelength was 
observed for all our samples. As illustrated 
in Fig. 1 it was particularly well defined 
for the glasses. The band center, which is 
located at approximately 2.83pm for all 
the samples, is in a region where there is an 
O-H stretch fundamental and so may be 
attributed to bound water present in the 
samples. The term bound water encom-
passes both physically and chemically 
bound water. The chemical analysis sum-
marized in Table I indicates that both 
types of bound water may have been 
present in the samples. H,O-refers to the 
amount of water driven off when the 


POLLACK,TOON,ANDKHARE 

sample was heated to lOO”C, while H,O+ 
refers to the amount subsequently driven 
off by increasing the temperature to 
1000”c. 

We have carried out two checks to firm 
up the identification of the 3-p” feature. 
First if the band is due to bound water the 
absorption coefficient should vary approxi-
mately linearly with the amount of bound 
water. This behavior can readily be seen 
in Fig. 1 by comparing the values of the 
extinction coefficients near 3pm for the 
obsidian glasses with that of the basaltic 
glass. The latter has about one-third the 
amount of bound water as the former. 
When corrections are made for the differ-
ent water contents the three glass samples 
show very similar, though not exactly the 
same, profiles of the 3-ym band. As a 
second check we computed the value of the 
integrated absorption coefficient for the 
3-pm band and compared it with the 
corresponding figure for ice (Irvine and 
Pollack, 1968). In performing this cal-
culation we extrapolated the rock co-
efficients to the case of 100% bound wrater. 
We found that the two figures were 
within a factor of 3 of one another, lending 
support to the identification. 

Houck et al. (1973) have found a strong 
3-pm feature in the reflectivity spectrum 
of Mars and have identified this feature as 
due to water of hydration. Using our 
optical constants for the 3-ym band they 
have been able to generate a synthetic 
spectrum for Mars, which matches quite 
closely with the one observed in this 
wavelength region. This comparison has 
also enabled them to estimate that the 
surface material contains 1% bound water 
by weight. We hope this will be only the 
first of many application of our data. 

C)ONCLUSION 

The refractive index and extinction 
coefficient of several igneous rocks and 
glasses have been found for wavelengths 
from the ultraviolet through the middle 
infrared. The experimental and theoretical 
techniques used are well understood, and 
most are standard practice. From 0.2 to 
5pm the optical constants are found 

directly from transmission and reflection 
measurements. The refractive index so 
obtained compares well with independent 
measurements and with values reported in 
the literature. The transmission measure-
ments for the glasses in this wavelength 
range obey Beer’s Law and are therefore 
likely to be reliable. Beyond 5pm the 
optical constants are found from a dis-
persion analysis. These constants agree 
with those obtained from transmission 
measurements in the region where both 
methods are applicable. The dispersion 
optical constants near the bands seem to be 
little influenced by small deviations from 
the experimental reflectivity or by failure 
to include small bands that are close to 
larger ones. The principle sources of error 
are likely to be beyond 30 pm where bands 
not included in the dispersion analysis 
may produce small errors, and in regions 
between Restrahlen bands where very low 
amplitude reflection features may have 
been overlooked. 

The optical constants of the rocks and 
glasses studied are comparable across the 
entire range of measurements. The only 
significant difference seems to be in the 
extinction coefficient shortward of 4 pm. 
This differs by as much as two orders of 
magnitude between rocks and glasses, and 
one order of magnitude between the two 
samples of obsidian. The two samples of 
obsidian otherwise produce nearly identical 
reflection features, have nearly identical 
dispersion parameters and differ little in 
their refractive indices. All the samples 
display a band near 3pm, which is attri- 
buted to bound water. 

The techniques used here are applicable 
to any dielectric capable of being polished 
and cut into thin sections.
